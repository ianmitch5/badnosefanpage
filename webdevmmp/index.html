	<h1>FANPAGE FOR MIRAGE CITY'S LOCAL GARDENER</h1>
	<p>Mr. Badnose is a character from the videogame "Mirage City" produced by the company “Engination”. He's Mirage's City's local gardener, he works day and night growing crops for the resident's, despite his grumpy attitude, his work is greatly appreciated. Interestingly, Mr. Badnose seems to be one of the only characters within the game to be aware that he's nothing more but a videogame character and he's sometimes seen as the town's "crazy man" as he goes around spreading "conspiracy theory's" of what the town and people really are and that they're trapped. The player can interact with Mr. Badnose to buy and sell food goods and plants. </p>
